# google-homepage
Google homepage mockup /simple/

This is a project I'm very excited to work on.

Essentially, I am going to try and build a very basic Google homepage
that looks and feels similar! Also, I'll try my best to do the search results
page!

What I'm going to learn from this

-A LOT OF CSS (I need to practice this a lot)
-Some basic actual webpage work (Dig deeper!)
-Working links & Github Pages (free hosting lol)
